# iOS Weather Application

This project is very similar to a project I did in Node with Express.

I used a few tutorials on looking at API use in iOS / Swift as I haven't really touched it but I found it to be very similar in its implementation to Node / Express, except there wasn't really any mention of .env files to secure keys. 

I used Core Location with a Map kit to display current location and this works well, I just haven't been able to grab the longitude and latitude and put them through the Apple Dev recommended Coder - GeoCoder. This is something I need to look at in the future.

You are able to request any location from the API and it feeds back either an error if it cannot find the city or it will display the temperature in a label and the rest of the data in the console. 

The thing that I would like to look at is bringing the data together and showing the temperature and with more research, I feel I would be able to do that. 

I have used MapKit to display static information and this was my first time using it to display current location, so it has been a very informative project and has definitely given me things to research.
